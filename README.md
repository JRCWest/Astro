# SpaceMiner

### SETUP

All Blinks begin as Asteroids. Each player should grab one Blink and take it aside. Scatter all remaining Blinks across the play surface, making sure that all Blinks are at least six inches apart, to create the asteroid field. Once they're all scattered, choose a relatively central Blink and long-press it until it changes state and becomes the Depot.

Each player should also long-press their Blink until it turns into a Depot. Let go and long-press again and the Blink will turn into a Ship. It should look something like this.

Players can now place their ships anywhere on the boundary of the aasteroid field. Your setup should look something like this, although number of blinks and exact composition will be unique to each game.

Start a countdown from 5. When you reach 0, play begins.

### GAMEPLAY

There are no "turns" in Space Miner. Once play begins, all players are free to move and mine as they please.

Your goal is to mine the asteroid field for colored ore. The ore you're collecting is indicated by the dim arc of color on the back of your ship. Move towards and attach to asteroids with the same colored ore to begin mining.

To move, flick your Blink. You can do this freely during the game, so long as your Blink comes to a rest between each flick. You may attach to asteroids, the depot, or even other ships in this process. If you are attached to a Blink and wish to move away, you are allowed to physically separate your Blink from the other before flicking it again. Do your best not to move either Blink too far from where it was when attached.

When your ship is attached to a Blink with compatible ore, it will begin mining. You can be able to see the ore on the asteroid diminish as your cargo hold fills. Asteroids that are mined of all or nearly all of their ore will reset after a brief period. In addition, any asteroid that is not mined for X seconds will also reset to a new ore type. This helps ensure a diversity of ore types across the field.

Filling your entire hold takes around 3 seconds, and you may need to visit several asteroids to acomplish this. Once you've filled your cargo hold, it will begin to flash a golden yellow, which means your mission is complete.

Now that your mission is complete, you must deposit it at the depot. Separate yourself from the asteroid you were mining from and flick your ship towards the depot. Once you are attached to the depot, your cargo hold will empty, you will be awarded one victory point, a new mission will be assigned to you.

The game ends when one player has acquired X victory points.
